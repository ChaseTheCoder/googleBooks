# Command Line Google Book Search

Command line application using JavaScript and Node.js that uses Google Book API to search for books and locally save a reading list of your favorites.

## Installation and Use

Clone and run npm install to locally run and save reading list.


```bash
npm install
```

To use, run the following in the terminal.

```bash
node index
```

## Libraries & Frameworks

* 'inquirer' A collection of common interactive command line user interfaces.
* 'node-fetch' a lightweight module that brings window.fetch to node.js
* 'jest' a JavaScript testing framework

## Project Status

'node index' works and is user friendly.  Can search Google Books API, see 5 results, and save to a Reading List locally.

Jest Testing set up.  Having issues with testing data. Jest failed to parse a file. This happens e.g. when your code or its dependencies use non-standard JavaScript syntax, or when Jest is not configured to support such syntax.  Will research this to be able to utilize testData.js to run multitple tests quickly oppose to using the api.

### Next Actions

Will research Jest error to be able to utilize testData.js to run multitple tests quickly oppose to using the api.

Build a catch for Google Books API request with no results.  Causes terminal to end session.

Refactor code to be 'clean code.'  Been watching workshops by Uncle Bob (Robert Cecil Martin) to develop my clean coding skills.
